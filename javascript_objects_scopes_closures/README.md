Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports object-oriented programming concepts and functional programming paradigms. Understanding the concepts of objects, scopes, and closures is crucial to writing efficient and maintainable JavaScript code.

This project aims to provide hands-on examples and explanations to deepen your understanding of these fundamental concepts and how they work in the context of JavaScript.

Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

Objects: Understanding how to create, modify, and work with objects in JavaScript, including object literals, constructor functions, and prototypes.

Scopes: Understanding the different scopes in JavaScript, including global scope, function scope, and block scope, and how variable declarations and assignments work within these scopes.

Closures: Exploring closures, a powerful feature in JavaScript, and understanding how they enable maintaining state and encapsulation in functions.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of JavaScript programming language.
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any preferred editor).
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-objects-scopes-closures.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd javascript-objects-scopes-closures
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Usage
Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a specific topic (objects, scopes, closures). Inside each directory, you'll find code examples and explanations for that particular topic.

To run the code examples, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
node path/to/your/javascript/file.js
Replace path/to/your/javascript/file.js with the actual path to the JavaScript file you want to execute.

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and experiment with different scenarios to solidify your understanding.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

lua
